Jupyter notebooks for the practical lab sessions of the "Supervised vs. unsupervised learning in deep PDE solvers" course 
at the [in-DEEP workshop](https://www.in-deep.science/activities/workshop-pavia-may-2025) held in Pavia on May 14-16, 2025.

The notebooks show
- how to construct a Neural Network and verify a classic result in approximation theory (lab1)
- the behaviour of optimization schemes on some test two-dimensional loss functions (lab2)
- how to solve simple ODEs/PDEs with PINNs (lab3)
- how to approximate the solution operators of PDEs with deep operator networks (lab4) and Fourier Neural Operators (lab6)
- how to apply PINNs to inverse problems (lab5)
